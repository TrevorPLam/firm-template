# AGENTS Governance Entrypoint

## Purpose
This governance pack defines the mandatory operating rules for autonomous and human contributors in this repository.

## Inputs
- Repository-level policy files under `AGENTS/policies/`.
- Task workflow files under `AGENTS/tasks/`.
- Existing contribution docs under `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `docs/`.

## Outputs
- Enforceable policy boundaries for tooling, safety, architecture, and coding practices.
- Deterministic task lifecycle (`BACKLOG -> TODO -> ARCHIVE`).

## Invariants
1. Never weaken security, tenancy, or compliance controls for convenience.
2. Execute only active TODO items unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
3. Every completed task must include verification evidence and archival notes.
4. Unknowns must be recorded as `UNKNOWN` with the source file needed to resolve them.

## Required Read Order
1. `AGENTS/AGENTS.toon` (this file)
2. `AGENTS/policies/TOOL_POLICY.md`
3. `AGENTS/policies/SAFETY_POLICY.md`
4. `AGENTS/policies/ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`
5. `AGENTS/policies/CODING_STANDARDS.md`
6. `AGENTS/tasks/BACKLOG.toon`
7. `AGENTS/tasks/TODO.toon`
8. `AGENTS/tasks/ARCHIVE.toon`
9. Supporting docs referenced by active tasks
## Escalation
If policy conflicts occur, precedence is:
1. Safety and security policy
2. System/developer/user instructions in runtime context (subject to safety and compliance constraints)
3. Architecture rules
4. Coding standards
5. Task-level instructions
