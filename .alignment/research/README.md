# ALIGNMENT Research

This directory holds evidence and best-practice research that supports the ALIGNMENT standards and principles.

## In this repository

This copy of the ALIGNMENT standard may not include all research documents. When present, topic-specific research files follow the pattern `NN-Section-Name-Research.md` (e.g. `03-Configuration-Environment-Research.md`).

## Contents

- **[MASTER-RESEARCH-SUMMARY.md](MASTER-RESEARCH-SUMMARY.md)** – High-level overview of research topics and how they map to standards.

## Purpose

Research documents provide:

- Evidence and references for standard requirements
- Deeper dives into specific topics
- Links to external best practices and prior art

For the full research set, see the upstream ALIGNMENT repository (if applicable).
