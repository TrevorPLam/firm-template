# Backend Placeholder

This repository is a **Next.js** application. The active backend logic lives in the root Next.js codebase (for example, `app/api/`).

## Status
- This directory is intentionally a **placeholder** and is not used by the current application.
- If a standalone backend is added in the future, the standard stack for this org is **Django 4.2** on **Python 3.11**.

## Where to Work Today
- Next.js routes and API handlers: `app/`
- Shared UI: `components/`
- Shared utilities: `lib/`
