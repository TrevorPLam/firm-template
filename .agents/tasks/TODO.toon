ALIGN-003, Align your-dedicated-marketer with platform, Partially Complete, P0, Team, 2026-02-28, App uses custom Hero and hardcoded colors (white slate-800); no @repo/patterns; no middleware. Bring to platform baseline., Use @repo/patterns Hero (thin wrapper with content); Replace white/slate-800 with token classes (e.g. background-alt foreground-muted); Add middleware.ts ported from web (security headers payload limit); Document or remove any intentional deviations., , STATUS: Hero now uses @repo/patterns; middleware exists; remaining work is token class migration (41 instances of hardcoded colors in components).
ALIGN-006, Section 1 root file count, Complete, P1, Team, 2026-02-28, Root has 14 files; standard asks ≤10. Either reduce or document deviation., Option A: Move .markdownlint.json .prettierrc.js .prettierignore to config/ and update tool config. Option B: Keep as is and confirm deviation in STANDARDS-VALIDATION-REPORT., , Deviation documented in STANDARDS-VALIDATION-REPORT line 55: many tools expect config in root.
BACKLOG-005, Add your-dedicated-marketer to root README, P2, Team, 2026-02, README lists only web and template-site under apps; your-dedicated-marketer exists but not listed., Update README project structure to include your-dedicated-marketer; Clarify role (second client vs template)., ALIGN-003, Moved from BACKLOG for completion.
