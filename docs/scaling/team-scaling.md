# Team Scaling Strategy

## Role Framework

| Role | Scope | Ratio |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Delivery lead | Portfolio oversight | 1 per 8-10 clients |
| QA lead | Quality gates | 1 per 4-6 clients |
| Account lead | Stakeholder comms | 1 per 6-8 clients |

## Capacity Planning Formula

```
Capacity (clients) = (Team size * Utilization) / Average client effort
```

## Onboarding Cadence

- Week 1: platform walkthrough + shadowing.
- Week 2: co-own 1-2 client releases.
- Week 3: independent ownership with weekly check-ins.
