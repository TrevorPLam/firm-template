## Purpose
This folder stores deprecated or historical documentation so context is preserved without
cluttering active guidance. Use it for reference only; do not treat archived files as
current source-of-truth.

## How to Use the Archive
- Prefer active docs listed in `docs/DOCS_INDEX.md` before consulting archives.
- Archived docs should be used for historical context, change rationale, or migration
  references when current docs point to them.

## Archiving Rules (Quick Reference)
- Archived documents must start with:
  - **ARCHIVED** or **DEPRECATED**
  - **Replaced by:** (if there is a newer doc)
  - **Reason:** (why it was archived)
- Keep only one active version of a doc outside this folder.
- If you are unsure whether to delete a doc, archive it and note why.

## Archive Structure
- Prefer: `docs/ARCHIVE/<YYYY>/<topic>/...` for dated materials.
- The `/docs/ARCHIVE/` root may include legacy docs preserved for traceability.

## Legacy Notes
- `docs/ARCHIVE/README-OLD.md` is retained for historical reference.
