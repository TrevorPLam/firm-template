# AI Usage Guidelines & Ethical Considerations

## Core Principles

- **Transparency:** disclose AI assistance when required by clients or policy.
- **Privacy:** avoid sending sensitive client data to third-party models.
- **Accuracy:** mandate human review before publishing externally.
- **Bias mitigation:** review outputs for biased or exclusionary language.

## Data Handling Rules

- Never include PII in prompts unless contractually allowed.
- Redact client names when testing prompt variations.
- Store prompt logs with minimal metadata.

## Approval Workflow

1. Draft AI output.
2. Review for accuracy and compliance.
3. Obtain client approval for externally published content.

## Escalation Triggers

- Content touching regulated industries (health, finance, legal).
- Claims involving performance guarantees or legal statements.
- Sensitive topics (politics, children, medical advice).
