# Content Management Workflows

## Standard Workflow

1. **Draft:** author writes initial content.
2. **Review:** editor validates structure and tone.
3. **Legal/brand check:** ensure compliance requirements.
4. **Approved:** ready for publishing.
5. **Published:** visible on production channels.

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Author:** drafts content and resolves feedback.
- **Editor:** checks style and accuracy.
- **Publisher:** handles final release.

## Workflow Automation

```ts
const workflow = ["draft", "review", "approved", "published"]; // Keep stage names stable for analytics.
```
