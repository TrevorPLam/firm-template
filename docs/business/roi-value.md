# ROI Analysis & Value Proposition

## Core Value Levers

1. **Delivery velocity:** faster launches and more client throughput.
2. **Quality stability:** reduced regressions and rework costs.
3. **Operational leverage:** fewer manual handoffs, fewer blockers.

## Baseline Metrics to Collect

- Average delivery cycle time (idea → launch)
- Rework rate (% of tasks reopened)
- Client churn / retention rate
- Hours per release (dev, QA, PM)

## ROI Calculation Model

```
ROI (%) = ((Annual Benefit - Annual Cost) / Annual Cost) * 100
Annual Benefit = (Time Saved * Billable Rate) + (Retention Lift * Contract Value)
```

## Example Narrative

> By reducing release time from 6 weeks to 3 weeks, a 20-person agency can double launch capacity without adding headcount. The result is a 20-30% uplift in billable project throughput within 6 months.

## Value Proposition Pillars

- **Confidence:** predictable delivery for every client.
- **Speed:** campaign velocity without chaos.
- **Scale:** standardized operations for growth.

## Risk Mitigation Points

- Clearly defined governance and QA gates.
- Rollback-ready deployment workflows.
- Audit trails for client and compliance needs.
