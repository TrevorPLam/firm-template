# Target Market Segmentation & Ideal Customer Profiles

## Segmentation Framework

| Segment | Primary Need | Buying Trigger | Product Fit | ICP Signal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Boutique agencies (5-25) | Delivery consistency | Missed launch deadlines | High | Repeated project overruns |
| Mid-market agencies (25-150) | Multi-client ops | Scale without headcount | High | >10 active clients |
| Enterprise studios (150+) | Governance & risk | Compliance pressure | Medium | Formal QA/security gates |
| In-house marketing teams | Speed & autonomy | Campaign velocity | Medium | Multiple launches/quarter |

## ICP Definition Template

Use this template for each ICP narrative:

- **Company profile:** size, industry, region, service mix
- **Primary pain:** operational bottleneck or risk exposure
- **Decision maker:** role, KPI ownership, influence chain
- **Buying trigger:** business event that accelerates adoption
- **Success proof:** measurable outcomes within 90 days

## Qualification Signals

- **Process maturity:** documented delivery checklists or QA gates.
- **Tooling stack:** CMS adoption, analytics maturity, CI/CD usage.
- **Capacity gap:** recurring backlog or missed SLAs.
- **Growth priority:** expansion to new verticals or markets.

## Messaging Notes

Map each ICP to a single dominant narrative: reliability, speed, or governance. Keep one lead message per persona to avoid dilution.
