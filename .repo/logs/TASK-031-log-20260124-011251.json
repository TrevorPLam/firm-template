  "actions": [
    "Added CodeQL workflow configuration in .github/workflows/codeql.yml for JavaScript/TypeScript and Python analysis.",
    "Added Trivy filesystem scan workflow in .github/workflows/trivy.yml with CRITICAL/HIGH failure thresholds and SARIF upload.",
    "Added Gitleaks secret scan workflow in .github/workflows/gitleaks.yml with SARIF output and exit code on leaks.",

    "Use CodeQL security-extended and security-and-quality query packs for broader coverage.",
