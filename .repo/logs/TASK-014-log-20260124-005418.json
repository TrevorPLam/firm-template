    "Added frontmatter and BlogPost validation with Zod in lib/blog.ts and wired parsing to fail fast.",
    "Created task packet and updated TODO/ARCHIVE/BACKLOG task tracking files.",
    "Generated trace and agent logs and ran npm run lint."

  "evidence": [
    "npm run lint (failed: existing repo lint errors in .repo/automation scripts and lib/sanitize.ts)."

  "decisions": [
    "Treat validation work as a feature change requiring a task packet.",
    "Throw on invalid frontmatter to fail builds early with actionable messages."
  ],
  "risks": [
    "Existing content with invalid frontmatter will now fail builds until corrected."

  "follow_ups": [
    "Address existing lint failures in automation scripts if lint gating is required for CI."

  "reasoning_summary": "Added Zod validation to ensure blog frontmatter aligns with the BlogPost contract and surfaces missing or invalid fields with clear errors, while documenting task progress and verification evidence.",
  "notes": "No secrets. No private data. No raw chain-of-thought."
