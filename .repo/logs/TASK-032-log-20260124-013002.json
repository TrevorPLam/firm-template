  "evidence": [
    "npm run lint failed with pre-existing ESLint errors in automation scripts and lib/sanitize.ts."

  "decisions": [
    "Used SPDX JSON SBOM output for compatibility with standard tooling.",
    "Assumed slsa-github-generator publishes a provenance artifact named 'slsa-provenance' containing provenance.intoto.jsonl."
