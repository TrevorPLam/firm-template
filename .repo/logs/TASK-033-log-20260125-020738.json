  "plan": [
    "Add semantic-release configuration and release workflow",
    "Add release changelog and update governance changelog",
    "Add E2E coverage for pricing page",
    "Run required tests and capture evidence",

  "actions": [
    "Created .releaserc.cjs with semantic-release plugins and npmPublish disabled",
    "Added .github/workflows/release.yml with dry-run workflow_dispatch support",
    "Added CHANGELOG.md for automated release notes",
    "Added pricing page Playwright test",
    "Updated task tracking and governance changelog"
  ],
  "evidence": [
    "npm install failed due to registry 403, blocking dependency installs",
    "npm run lint/type-check/test/test:e2e failed because dependencies could not be installed"
  ],
  "decisions": [
    "Use npx with explicit --package flags in the release workflow so plugins resolve without local devDependencies",
    "Keep npmPublish disabled because the project is marked private"
  ],
  "risks": [
    "Release workflow depends on registry access during GitHub Actions runs",
    "Local verification is limited until npm registry access is available"
  ],
  "follow_ups": [
    "Run the release workflow in dry-run mode on a test branch in GitHub",
    "Re-run lint, type-check, unit tests, and E2E tests after dependencies can install"
  ],
  "reasoning_summary": "Implemented release automation artifacts and added E2E coverage while documenting the current dependency-installation block that prevents local verification.",
  "notes": "No secrets. No private data. No raw chain-of-thought."
