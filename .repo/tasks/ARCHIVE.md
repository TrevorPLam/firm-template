### [TASK-003] Fix Duplicate Content in CI Workflow ✓
- **Priority:** P0
- **Status:** Completed
- **Created:** 2026-01-23
- **Completed:** 2026-01-25
- **Context:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` has two conflicting workflow definitions causing confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Remove duplicate workflow definition
- [x] Ensure single coherent CI pipeline
- [x] Verify all jobs run correctly
- [x] Test on a branch before merging

#### Outcome
- Removed the duplicate CI workflow file and kept a single CI pipeline definition under `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Ran `npm run lint`, which failed due to pre-existing lint errors in automation scripts; CI job execution should still be verified in a branch run.

### [TASK-002] Create .env.example File ✓
- **Priority:** P0
- **Status:** Completed
- **Created:** 2026-01-23
- **Completed:** 2026-01-24
- **Context:** Code references `.env.example` but file doesn't exist. Blocks new environment setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Document all required environment variables from `env_validator.py`
- [x] Include comments explaining each variable
- [x] Add placeholder values (never real secrets)
- [x] Reference in README.md and docs/getting-started/onboarding.md

#### Outcome
- Added `.env.example` based on current environment validation in `lib/env.ts` and kept placeholders/comments aligned.
- Updated README and added onboarding documentation to reference `.env.example` and required variables.

### [TASK-013] Make Rate Limiting Production-Ready ✓
- **Priority:** P0
- **Status:** Completed
- **Created:** 2026-01-23
- **Completed:** 2026-01-24
- **Context:** In-memory rate limiter fallback is not suitable for multi-instance production deployments. Each instance would have its own map, allowing rate limit bypass.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Make Upstash Redis required in production (`NODE_ENV === 'production'`)
- [x] Fail-fast with clear error message if Upstash not configured in production
- [x] Remove in-memory fallback or clearly document it's dev-only
- [x] Update `lib/actions.ts:481-502` to enforce production requirement

#### Outcome
- Enforced Upstash Redis requirement in production with fail-fast behavior and dev-only fallback documentation in `lib/actions.ts`.
- Documented production requirement for Upstash env vars in `lib/env.ts`.

## Completed Tasks

### [TASK-012] Document or Remove Placeholder Directories ✓
- **Priority:** P0
- **Status:** Completed
- **Created:** 2026-01-23
- **Completed:** 2026-01-23
- **Context:** `backend/` and `frontend/` directories are empty placeholders causing confusion. They contain Django/React Query references incompatible with this Next.js project.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Add README.md in each directory explaining they're placeholders, OR
- [x] Remove directories entirely (recommended)
- [x] Update all documentation to clarify these are not used
- [x] Remove or update misleading `.AGENT.md` files with Django references

#### Outcome
- Added placeholder README files in `backend/` and `frontend/`.
- Removed misleading placeholder `.AGENT.md` files.
- Updated documentation references in `docs/CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md` and governance task docs.

### [TASK-001] Refine AGENTS.md to Be Concise & Effective ✓
- **Priority:** P0
- **Status:** Completed
- **Created:** 2026-01-23
- **Completed:** 2026-01-23
- **Context:** Current AGENTS.md is 22 lines. Best practice is 50-100 lines that are highly specific and example-driven, NOT verbose documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Include all six core areas: Commands, Testing, Project Structure, Code Style, Git Workflow, Boundaries
- [x] Add specific tech stack with versions (Django 4.2 + Python 3.11 + React 18 + TypeScript)
- [x] Include 1-2 code examples (showing patterns, not explaining them)
- [x] Document clear boundaries (what agents must NEVER do)
- [x] Keep total length under 100 lines

#### Outcome
- Rewrote `AGENTS.md` to a concise format with required sections, tech stack, and examples.
