# Module Boundaries

**File**: `.repo/policy/BOUNDARIES.md`

This file defines module boundaries. Boundaries are enforced.

> **Related**: See `.repo/policy/PRINCIPLES.md` Principle 13 (Respect Boundaries by Default) and Principle 14 (Localize Complexity).

## Model
hybrid_domain_feature_layer

## Directory pattern
src/<domain>/<feature>/<layer>/
Shared platform directory: src/platform/

## Default allowed import direction (Plain English)
- UI layer may depend on Domain layer
- Domain layer may depend on Data layer
- Data layer may depend on Platform (shared) layer
- Platform depends on nothing

Machine form:
ui → domain → data → shared_platform

## Cross-feature rule
Cross-feature imports require an ADR (see Principle 23: ADR Required When Triggered).

## Enforcement method
hybrid_static_checker_plus_manifest
Meaning: a static boundary checker runs AND the manifest contains explicit edges for allowed exceptions.

## Exceptions
- Small exception: allowed only with explicit Task Packet justification + filepaths.
- Large exception: requires ADR.
All exceptions must be represented as explicit edges in `repo.manifest.yaml`.

## Violation severity
waiver_plus_auto_task
Meaning: if boundaries are violated:
- PR is blocked unless fixed or waived
- if waived, an auto-task is created in TODOs with remediation plan

## Boundary visibility
inline_comments_plus_summary
Meaning: boundary-related decisions must be visible in code comments where relevant and summarized in PR narration (see Principle 17: PR Narration).

## Practical examples (Plain English)
Allowed:
- `src/sales/checkout/ui/*` imports `src/sales/checkout/domain/*`

Forbidden:
- UI imports Data directly
- Any layer imports another feature in a different feature folder without ADR
- Anything imports Platform and then re-exports it as a shortcut across features

## firm-template-Specific Notes
This repository uses Next.js App Router structure. Components should be organized in `components/`, utilities in `lib/`, and routes in `app/`. Cross-cutting concerns should be kept in shared utilities. See `.repo/policy/BESTPR.md` for project organization patterns.
