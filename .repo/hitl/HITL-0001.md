## Summary

Test release workflow on a test branch

## What Is Wrong

We cannot run or verify the GitHub Actions release workflow from this environment, so the required test run has not been performed.

## What Is Needed

A human needs to trigger the Release workflow in GitHub Actions on a test branch with dry-run enabled and record the result.

## Required Human Action Steps

1. Trigger the `Release` workflow on a test branch using workflow_dispatch with `dry_run=true`.
2. Confirm the semantic-release dry-run completes successfully and posts expected output.
3. Record the workflow run link in Evidence of Completion and mark Status as Completed.

## Evidence of Completion

- [Add workflow run URL and notes when completed]

## Related Artifacts

- **PR:** [PR number or link]
- **Task Packet:** TASK-033
- **ADR:** [ADR reference if applicable]
- **Waiver:** [Waiver reference if applicable]

## Notes

This HITL item is required to satisfy the TASK-033 acceptance criterion for testing the release workflow.
